This application/program written in c++ demonstrates how to write a VB client for an AI ChatBot. The code itself is only a few pages, documented and easy to understand. This example uses the What are Transplantable Artificial Neurological Units (TANU) architecture. After you download this VB Chatbot client code point from my GITHUB https://github.com/shivamksharma/ChatBot-in-Cplusplus to create and train your AI chatbot. Then use this open source client to chat with him/her.

You can also modify this code to bind your AI chatbot to both IRC and non-IRC chat systems.
